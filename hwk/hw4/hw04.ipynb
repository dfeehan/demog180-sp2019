    "In this homework assignment, we're going to explore the concept of *small worlds*, which we discussed in class earlier this semester.  Small worlds have long been studied by social networks researchers, and they have also been discussed in popular culture. As a reminder, the rough idea is that social networks can typically be expected to have two characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a high level of clustering\n",
    "* a short average path length\n",
    "\n",
    "A high level of clustering is consistent with the idea of triadic closure. And a short average path length is supposed to capture situations we often seem to encounter in our day to day lives: e.g., two strangers find that they have an unexpected acquaintance in common and exclaim \"it's a small world!\" (see the Milgram article below).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to try to assess how well these two small world predictions hold up empirically. We're going to focus on the Add Health networks. We should bear in mind that the small world theory is really about very large networks, so we will be evaluating it in an unusual situation: networks of moderate size taken from children who all live in the same community.\n",
