    "**Question 6** Write a simulation that explores what impact innoculating each node in the network has on the number of people that are infected. You should loop through each node in the network `er_net_example` and simulate 1000 ER epidemics with that node innoculated. (So, only one node is ever innoculated.) Keep track of which node was innoculated and the number of people that were infected; put these simulation results into a Table called `sim_res`.\n",
